            </div>
            <div class="blog-body">
            <h2>Chapter 1: Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra</h2>
              <p>Two armies, those of the Pandavas and the Kauravas, face each other on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra. Many
                signs indicate victory for the Pandavas. Dhrtarashtra, the Pandavas’ uncle and the Kauravas’ father, doubts
                the possibility of his sons’ victory and asks Sanjaya, his secretary, to describe the scene on the
                battlefield.</p>
            <picture class="featured-image featured-image--right">

            </picture>        
              <p>Arjuna, one of five Pandava brothers, undergoes a crisis just before the fight. He is overwhelmed by
                compassion for his family members and teachers, whom he is supposed to kill. After submitting before Krishna
                many noble and moral reasons why he wishes not to fight, Arjuna casts aside his weapons, overwhelmed with
                grief. Arjuna’s reluctance to fight indicates his kind heart; such a person is fit to receive transcendental
                knowledge.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 2: Contents of the Gita Summarized</h2>
              <p>Krishna does not sympathize with Arjuna’s arguments. Rather, He reminds Arjuna that his duty is to fight and
                orders him to overcome his weakness of heart. Arjuna is torn between his aversion to killing his relatives and
                Krishna’s desire that he should fight. Aggrieved and confused, Arjuna asks Krishna for guidance and becomes
                his disciple.</p>
            <picture class="featured-image featured-image--left">
              <img src="/images/bhagavadgita-6.jpg";/>
            </picture>  
              <p>Krishna takes up the role of Arjuna’s Spiritual Master and teaches him that the soul is eternal and cannot be
                killed. Dying in battle promotes a fighter to the heavenly planets, so Arjuna should rejoice that those
                persons he is about to kill will achieve superior births. A person is eternally an individual. Only his body
                perishes. Thus, there is nothing to lament.
              </p>
              <p>Arjuna’s decision not to fight is based on his desire to enjoy life with his relatives, even at the cost of
                wisdom and duty. Such a mentality keeps one bound to the material world. Krishna advises Arjuna to engage in
                buddhi-yoga, work without attachment to the results. By fighting in this way, Arjuna will free himself from
                the cycle of birth and death and become eligible to enter the kingdom of God.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 3: Karma – Yoga</h2>
              <p>Arjuna is still confused. He thinks that buddhi-yoga means that one should retire from active life and practice penance and austerities. But Krishna says, “no. Fight! But do it in a spirit of renunciation and offer all the results to the Supreme. This is the best purification. By working without attachment, one attains the Supreme.”</p>
              <p>Performing sacrifices for the pleasure of the Lord guarantees material prosperity and freedom from sinful reactions. Even a self-realized person never gives up his duty. He acts for the sake of educating others.</p>
              <p>Arjuna then asks the Lord what it is that causes one to engage in sinful acts. Krishna answers that it is lust which induces one to sin. This lust bewilders one and entangles one in the material world. Lust presents itself in the senses, mind, and intelligence, but it can be counteracted by self – control.</p>
